# Shell Simulation
( Please note that this project is a personal weekend project of mine. As such, it may not include the usual level of detail or completeness found in more extensive projects )

## Overview
Shell Simulation is a project aimed at simulating the impact dynamics and deformation of tank shells. The simulation provides insights into how tank shells behave upon impact with various surfaces and materials.

## Features
- Simulates tank shell impact dynamics.
- Models deformation of shells upon impact.
- Provides visualizations of impact results.

## Installation
To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/shell-sim.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd shell-sim
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```
   python code1.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Modify the parameters in `code1.py` to simulate different scenarios.
2. Run the simulation using the provided Python script.
3. Analyze the output to understand the impact dynamics and deformation behavior of tank shells.

## Examples
Here are some example scenarios you can simulate with this project:
- Impact of tank shell on concrete wall
- Deformation of tank shell upon hitting armored steel
- Behavior of shell fragments after explosion
